            </h2>
            <p>While the rest of the country is blanketed in snow in March, Miami is typically 69 to 75 degrees with virtually no rain or humidity, making it the perfect winter playground for you to escape to. Pair that with the location of the Summit, the Hotel Intercontinental Miami, which is in the heart of the city and minutes from the beaches, you’ve got the perfect recipe for a winter getaway while learning about all things Addigy.</p>
